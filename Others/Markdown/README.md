# Markdown

**Markdown is a way to style text on the web**    
Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com    

## **Text**

*This text will be italic*
> start, end *   

_This will also be italic_
> start, end _   

**This text will be bold**
> start, end two **    

__This will also be bold__
> start, end two __   

_You **can** combine them_
> _ * text * _    

## **List**

Numbered lists:
>number point space

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Bullet points:
>one * and space

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Sub point 1
  - Sub point 2

## **Headers & Quotes**    

# Structured documents
> one # example

Different levels starts lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading
> Three # example

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

To quote use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

## **Code**  

Code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```  

Syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

## **A collapsible section with markdown**

  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

  ## Head
  1. Option 1
  2. Option 2
     * With some
     * Sub bullets
</details>

```
